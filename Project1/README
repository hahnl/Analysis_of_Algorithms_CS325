Project 1, Group 7

proj1.cpp



Introduction
-------------------

This program runs 4 different algorithms in order to 
read arrays from a file and solve the maximum subarray
problem on each array.



Included Files
-------------------
README
proj1.cpp
MSS_Problems.txt
MSS_Results.txt



Running the Program
-------------------

To run this program, first ensure that included files are in the same folder.
Then, compile with the following line:
g++ proj1.cpp -o proj1

When this program runs, it will append results to the end of the MSS_Results.txt 
file. If you would like a fresh version of the results, with no other previous results, clear all contents of the MSS_Results.txt file. Save this cleared file.

To run the program, type the following line onto the command line:
./prog1

All results will be outputed to the MSS_Results.txt file.  Nothing will display in the terminal.


Looking at the Results
-------------------

To look at the results:
cat MSS_Results.txt



Running Experimental Analysis
-------------------

To run the experimental analysis on the algorithms ran in this program, you will need to
un-comment-out line 46 in proj1.cpp (remove the '//').

Then, recompile proj1.cpp:
g++ proj1.cpp -o proj1

Re-run the program:
./prog1

The results from the experimental analysis will be displayed in the terminal.
